<h2>Version Control</h2>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Why do we need it?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Many people's version-control method of choice is to copy files into another directory such as time-stamped directory if they are clever. This approach is common because it is so simple. However, it is also incredibly error-prone because it is easy to forget which directory you are in. Consequently, you could accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you do not mean to. The next major issue that people encounter is that they need to collaborate with developers on other systems. - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>How is it done?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>This is where Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCSs) such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar, and Darcs step in. In a DVCS, clients do more than check out the latest snapshot of files. They fully mirror the repository including its full history. If any server dies and these systems were collaborating via that server, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it. Every clone is really a full backup of all the data.  - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Git</h2>
<p><strong>Git</strong> is an open-source tool used by developers to establish version control in their projects using commands executed from the terminal. </p>
<p><strong>Github</strong> is a website/application that allows you to upload your git repository to the web for distributed collaboration, control, and storage. (Move of this wil be covered in the next section).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since its birth in 2005, Git has evolved and matured to be easy to use while retaining the initial qualities. It's amazingly fast, it's very efficient with large projects, and it has an incredible branching system for non-linear development. - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See Git Branching for more details.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nearly every operation is local. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most operations in Git need only local files and resources to operate. Information from another computer on your network is generally not needed.  - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Git has integrity </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything in Git is checksummed before being stored and is then referred to by that checksum. It is impossible to change the contents of any file or directory without Git knowing about it beforehand. This functionality is built into Git at the lowest levels and is integral to its philosophy. You canâ€™t lose information in transit or get file corruption without Git being able to detect it. - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Git generally only adds data</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you do actions in Git, nearly all of them only add data to the Git database. It is hard to get the system to do anything that cannot be undone or make it erase data in any way. As with any VCS, you can lose or mess up changes you have not committed yet. But after you commit a snapshot into Git, it is difficult to lose, especially if you regularly push your database to another repository. - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While there are many ways to use Git, the general approach follows these three stages.</p>
<p><br> <img src="https://charleskarpati.com/img/githubCommit.png" alt="Git Stages" title="Git Stages" height="300"/></p>
<p>Using Git can be accomplished through a variety of methods, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Directly through the <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line">command line</a></li>
<li>Using <a href="github.com">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> on the web</li>
<li>Using GitHub's simplied and user-friendly <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">desktop</a> application</li>
<li>Using the web based <a href="https://prose.io/">Prose.io</a> content editor</li>
</ul>
<h2>GitHub</h2>
<p>Whereas Git is used stand-alone for version control purposes, it is in tandem with GitHub (or Bitbucket). As a free survice, GitHub enriches existing features and adds further utility. To truly understand what this means, let's try it out for ourselves!</p>
<h3><strong>1: Create a GitHub account</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1a. <a href="https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&amp;ref_loc=header+logged+out&amp;ref_page=%2F&amp;source=header-home">Create</a> a new GitHub account.</strong> <br><img src="https://charleskarpati.com/img/githubcreate.png" height="400"/></p>
<p><strong>1b.</strong> The top right corner provide shortcuts to some of GitHub's best features.</p>
<p>The following shown below is the accounts dropdown.</p>
<p><strong>Click on the 'Your Profile' tab to go to a dashboard comprising all of your past works (if any).</strong></p>
<p><br><img src="https://charleskarpati.com/img/githubAccountTab.png" height="400"/></p>
<p>Your username will be the URL's basepath for all future projects.</p>
<p><strong>This basepath also serves as the link to your profile page.</strong></p>
<p>If you are feeling brave, click on different tabs in this dropdown to see how they relate to your profile page and basepath!</p>
<p><strong>For example, the link to my profile page is as follows:</strong>
<br><img src="https://charleskarpati.com/img/githuburl.png"/></p>
<p><strong>If you click on the 'Your Repositories' dropdown option:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The url changes to github.com/bnia?tab=repositories**</li>

<h2>Version Control</h2>

<h2>Version Control</h2>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Why do we need it?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Many people's version-control method of choice is to copy files into another directory such as time-stamped directory if they are clever. This approach is common because it is so simple. However, it is also incredibly error-prone because it is easy to forget which directory you are in. Consequently, you could accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you do not mean to. The next major issue that people encounter is that they need to collaborate with developers on other systems. - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>How is it done?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>This is where Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCSs) such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar, and Darcs step in. In a DVCS, clients do more than check out the latest snapshot of files. They fully mirror the repository including its full history. If any server dies and these systems were collaborating via that server, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it. Every clone is really a full backup of all the data.  - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Git</h2>
<p><strong>Git</strong> is an open-source tool used by developers to establish version control in their projects using commands executed from the terminal. </p>
<p><strong>Github</strong> is a website/application that allows you to upload your git repository to the web for distributed collaboration, control, and storage. (Move of this wil be covered in the next section).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since its birth in 2005, Git has evolved and matured to be easy to use while retaining the initial qualities. It's amazingly fast, it's very efficient with large projects, and it has an incredible branching system for non-linear development. - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See Git Branching for more details.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nearly every operation is local. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most operations in Git need only local files and resources to operate. Information from another computer on your network is generally not needed.  - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Git has integrity </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything in Git is checksummed before being stored and is then referred to by that checksum. It is impossible to change the contents of any file or directory without Git knowing about it beforehand. This functionality is built into Git at the lowest levels and is integral to its philosophy. You canâ€™t lose information in transit or get file corruption without Git being able to detect it. - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Git generally only adds data</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you do actions in Git, nearly all of them only add data to the Git database. It is hard to get the system to do anything that cannot be undone or make it erase data in any way. As with any VCS, you can lose or mess up changes you have not committed yet. But after you commit a snapshot into Git, it is difficult to lose, especially if you regularly push your database to another repository. - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While there are many ways to use Git, the general approach follows these three stages.</p>
<p><br> <img src="https://charleskarpati.com/img/githubCommit.png" alt="Git Stages" title="Git Stages" height="300"/></p>
<p>Using Git can be accomplished through a variety of methods, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Directly through the <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line">command line</a></li>
<li>Using <a href="github.com">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> on the web</li>
<li>Using GitHub's simplied and user-friendly <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">desktop</a> application</li>
<li>Using the web based <a href="https://prose.io/">Prose.io</a> content editor</li>
</ul>
<h2>GitHub</h2>
<p>Whereas Git is used stand-alone for version control purposes, it is in tandem with GitHub (or Bitbucket). As a free survice, GitHub enriches existing features and adds further utility. To truly understand what this means, let's try it out for ourselves!</p>
<h3><strong>1: Create a GitHub account</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1a. <a href="https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&amp;ref_loc=header+logged+out&amp;ref_page=%2F&amp;source=header-home">Create</a> a new GitHub account.</strong> <br><img src="https://charleskarpati.com/img/githubcreate.png" height="400"/></p>
<p><strong>1b.</strong> The top right corner provide shortcuts to some of GitHub's best features.</p>
<p>The following shown below is the accounts dropdown.</p>
<p><strong>Click on the 'Your Profile' tab to go to a dashboard comprising all of your past works (if any).</strong></p>
<p><br><img src="https://charleskarpati.com/img/githubAccountTab.png" height="400"/></p>
<p>Your username will be the URL's basepath for all future projects.</p>
<p><strong>This basepath also serves as the link to your profile page.</strong></p>
<p>If you are feeling brave, click on different tabs in this dropdown to see how they relate to your profile page and basepath!</p>
<p><strong>For example, the link to my profile page is as follows:</strong>
<br><img src="https://charleskarpati.com/img/githuburl.png"/></p>
<p><strong>If you click on the 'Your Repositories' dropdown option:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The url changes to github.com/bnia?tab=repositories**</li>
<li>The navigational tab on the topmost of my homepage will change from 'Overview' to 'Repositories'.

<h2>Version Control</h2>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Why do we need it?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Many people's version-control method of choice is to copy files into another directory such as time-stamped directory if they are clever. This approach is common because it is so simple. However, it is also incredibly error-prone because it is easy to forget which directory you are in. Consequently, you could accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you do not mean to. The next major issue that people encounter is that they need to collaborate with developers on other systems. - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>How is it done?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>This is where Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCSs) such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar, and Darcs step in. In a DVCS, clients do more than check out the latest snapshot of files. They fully mirror the repository including its full history. If any server dies and these systems were collaborating via that server, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it. Every clone is really a full backup of all the data.  - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Git</h2>
<p><strong>Git</strong> is an open-source tool used by developers to establish version control in their projects using commands executed from the terminal. </p>
<p><strong>Github</strong> is a website/application that allows you to upload your git repository to the web for distributed collaboration, control, and storage. (Move of this wil be covered in the next section).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since its birth in 2005, Git has evolved and matured to be easy to use while retaining the initial qualities. It's amazingly fast, it's very efficient with large projects, and it has an incredible branching system for non-linear development. - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See Git Branching for more details.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nearly every operation is local. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most operations in Git need only local files and resources to operate. Information from another computer on your network is generally not needed.  - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Git has integrity </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything in Git is checksummed before being stored and is then referred to by that checksum. It is impossible to change the contents of any file or directory without Git knowing about it beforehand. This functionality is built into Git at the lowest levels and is integral to its philosophy. You canâ€™t lose information in transit or get file corruption without Git being able to detect it. - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Git generally only adds data</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you do actions in Git, nearly all of them only add data to the Git database. It is hard to get the system to do anything that cannot be undone or make it erase data in any way. As with any VCS, you can lose or mess up changes you have not committed yet. But after you commit a snapshot into Git, it is difficult to lose, especially if you regularly push your database to another repository. - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While there are many ways to use Git, the general approach follows these three stages.</p>
<p><br> <img src="https://charleskarpati.com/img/githubCommit.png" alt="Git Stages" title="Git Stages" height="300"/></p>
<p>Using Git can be accomplished through a variety of methods, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Directly through the <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line">command line</a></li>
<li>Using <a href="github.com">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> on the web</li>
<li>Using GitHub's simplied and user-friendly <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">desktop</a> application</li>
<li>Using the web based <a href="https://prose.io/">Prose.io</a> content editor</li>
</ul>
<h2>GitHub</h2>
<p>Whereas Git is used stand-alone for version control purposes, it is in tandem with GitHub (or Bitbucket). As a free survice, GitHub enriches existing features and adds further utility. To truly understand what this means, let's try it out for ourselves!</p>
<h3><strong>1: Create a GitHub account</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1a. <a href="https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&amp;ref_loc=header+logged+out&amp;ref_page=%2F&amp;source=header-home">Create</a> a new GitHub account.</strong> <br><img src="https://charleskarpati.com/img/githubcreate.png" height="400"/></p>
<p><strong>1b.</strong> The top right corner provide shortcuts to some of GitHub's best features.</p>
<p>The following shown below is the accounts dropdown.</p>
<p><strong>Click on the 'Your Profile' tab to go to a dashboard comprising all of your past works (if any).</strong></p>
<p><br><img src="https://charleskarpati.com/img/githubAccountTab.png" height="400"/></p>
<p>Your username will be the URL's basepath for all future projects.</p>
<p><strong>This basepath also serves as the link to your profile page.</strong></p>
<p>If you are feeling brave, click on different tabs in this dropdown to see how they relate to your profile page and basepath!</p>
<p><strong>For example, the link to my profile page is as follows:</strong>
<br><img src="https://charleskarpati.com/img/githuburl.png"/></p>
<p><strong>If you click on the 'Your Repositories' dropdown option:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The url changes to github.com/bnia?tab=repositories**</li>
<li>The navigational tab on the topmost of my homepage will change from 'Overview' to 'Repositories'.

<h2>Version Control</h2>

<h2>Version Control</h2>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Why do we need it?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Many people's version-control method of choice is to copy files into another directory such as time-stamped directory if they are clever. This approach is common because it is so simple. However, it is also incredibly error-prone because it is easy to forget which directory you are in. Consequently, you could accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you do not mean to. The next major issue that people encounter is that they need to collaborate with developers on other systems. - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>How is it done?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>This is where Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCSs) such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar, and Darcs step in. In a DVCS, clients do more than check out the latest snapshot of files. They fully mirror the repository including its full history. If any server dies and these systems were collaborating via that server, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it. Every clone is really a full backup of all the data.  - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Git</h2>
<p><strong>Git</strong> is an open-source tool used by developers to establish version control in their projects using commands executed from the terminal. </p>
<p><strong>Github</strong> is a website/application that allows you to upload your git repository to the web for distributed collaboration, control, and storage. (Move of this wil be covered in the next section).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since its birth in 2005, Git has evolved and matured to be easy to use while retaining the initial qualities. It's amazingly fast, it's very efficient with large projects, and it has an incredible branching system for non-linear development. - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See Git Branching for more details.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nearly every operation is local. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most operations in Git need only local files and resources to operate. Information from another computer on your network is generally not needed.  - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Git has integrity </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything in Git is checksummed before being stored and is then referred to by that checksum. It is impossible to change the contents of any file or directory without Git knowing about it beforehand. This functionality is built into Git at the lowest levels and is integral to its philosophy. You canâ€™t lose information in transit or get file corruption without Git being able to detect it. - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Git generally only adds data</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you do actions in Git, nearly all of them only add data to the Git database. It is hard to get the system to do anything that cannot be undone or make it erase data in any way. As with any VCS, you can lose or mess up changes you have not committed yet. But after you commit a snapshot into Git, it is difficult to lose, especially if you regularly push your database to another repository. - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While there are many ways to use Git, the general approach follows these three stages.</p>
<p><br> <img src="https://charleskarpati.com/img/githubCommit.png" alt="Git Stages" title="Git Stages" height="300"/></p>
<p>Using Git can be accomplished through a variety of methods, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Directly through the <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line">command line</a></li>
<li>Using <a href="github.com">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> on the web</li>
<li>Using GitHub's simplied and user-friendly <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">desktop</a> application</li>
<li>Using the web based <a href="https://prose.io/">Prose.io</a> content editor</li>
</ul>
<h2>GitHub</h2>
<p>Whereas Git is used stand-alone for version control purposes, it is in tandem with GitHub (or Bitbucket). As a free survice, GitHub enriches existing features and adds further utility. To truly understand what this means, let's try it out for ourselves!</p>
<h3><strong>1: Create a GitHub account</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1a. <a href="https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&amp;ref_loc=header+logged+out&amp;ref_page=%2F&amp;source=header-home">Create</a> a new GitHub account.</strong> <br><img src="https://charleskarpati.com/img/githubcreate.png" height="400"/></p>
<p><strong>1b.</strong> The top right corner provide shortcuts to some of GitHub's best features.</p>
<p>The following shown below is the accounts dropdown.</p>
<p><strong>Click on the 'Your Profile' tab to go to a dashboard comprising all of your past works (if any).</strong></p>
<p><br><img src="https://charleskarpati.com/img/githubAccountTab.png" height="400"/></p>
<p>Your username will be the URL's basepath for all future projects.</p>
<p><strong>This basepath also serves as the link to your profile page.</strong></p>
<p>If you are feeling brave, click on different tabs in this dropdown to see how they relate to your profile page and basepath!</p>
<p><strong>For example, the link to my profile page is as follows:</strong>
<br><img src="https://charleskarpati.com/img/githuburl.png"/></p>
<p><strong>If you click on the 'Your Repositories' dropdown option:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The url changes to github.com/bnia?tab=repositories**</li>
<li>The navigational tab on the topmost of my homepage will change from 'Overview' to 'Repositories'.
<br><img src="https://charleskarpati.com/img/githubProfileRepos.png" height="150"/></li>

<h2>Version Control</h2>

<h2>Version Control</h2>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Why do we need it?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Many people's version-control method of choice is to copy files into another directory such as time-stamped directory if they are clever. This approach is common because it is so simple. However, it is also incredibly error-prone because it is easy to forget which directory you are in. Consequently, you could accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you do not mean to. The next major issue that people encounter is that they need to collaborate with developers on other systems. - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>How is it done?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>This is where Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCSs) such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar, and Darcs step in. In a DVCS, clients do more than check out the latest snapshot of files. They fully mirror the repository including its full history. If any server dies and these systems were collaborating via that server, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it. Every clone is really a full backup of all the data.  - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Git</h2>
<p><strong>Git</strong> is an open-source tool used by developers to establish version control in their projects using commands executed from the terminal. </p>
<p><strong>Github</strong> is a website/application that allows you to upload your git repository to the web for distributed collaboration, control, and storage. (Move of this wil be covered in the next section).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since its birth in 2005, Git has evolved and matured to be easy to use while retaining the initial qualities. It's amazingly fast, it's very efficient with large projects, and it has an incredible branching system for non-linear development. - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See Git Branching for more details.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nearly every operation is local. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most operations in Git need only local files and resources to operate. Information from another computer on your network is generally not needed.  - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Git has integrity </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything in Git is checksummed before being stored and is then referred to by that checksum. It is impossible to change the contents of any file or directory without Git knowing about it beforehand. This functionality is built into Git at the lowest levels and is integral to its philosophy. You canâ€™t lose information in transit or get file corruption without Git being able to detect it. - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Git generally only adds data</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you do actions in Git, nearly all of them only add data to the Git database. It is hard to get the system to do anything that cannot be undone or make it erase data in any way. As with any VCS, you can lose or mess up changes you have not committed yet. But after you commit a snapshot into Git, it is difficult to lose, especially if you regularly push your database to another repository. - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While there are many ways to use Git, the general approach follows these three stages.</p>
<p><br> <img src="https://charleskarpati.com/img/githubCommit.png" alt="Git Stages" title="Git Stages" height="300"/></p>
<p>Using Git can be accomplished through a variety of methods, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Directly through the <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line">command line</a></li>
<li>Using <a href="github.com">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> on the web</li>
<li>Using GitHub's simplied and user-friendly <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">desktop</a> application</li>
<li>Using the web based <a href="https://prose.io/">Prose.io</a> content editor</li>
</ul>
<h2>GitHub</h2>
<p>Whereas Git is used stand-alone for version control purposes, it is in tandem with GitHub (or Bitbucket). As a free survice, GitHub enriches existing features and adds further utility. To truly understand what this means, let's try it out for ourselves!</p>
<h3><strong>1: Create a GitHub account</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1a. <a href="https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&amp;ref_loc=header+logged+out&amp;ref_page=%2F&amp;source=header-home">Create</a> a new GitHub account.</strong> <br><img src="https://charleskarpati.com/img/githubcreate.png" height="400"/></p>
<p><strong>1b.</strong> The top right corner provide shortcuts to some of GitHub's best features.</p>
<p>The following shown below is the accounts dropdown.</p>
<p><strong>Click on the 'Your Profile' tab to go to a dashboard comprising all of your past works (if any).</strong></p>
<p><br><img src="https://charleskarpati.com/img/githubAccountTab.png" height="400"/></p>
<p>Your username will be the URL's basepath for all future projects.</p>
<p><strong>This basepath also serves as the link to your profile page.</strong></p>
<p>If you are feeling brave, click on different tabs in this dropdown to see how they relate to your profile page and basepath!</p>
<p><strong>For example, the link to my profile page is as follows:</strong>
<br><img src="https://charleskarpati.com/img/githuburl.png"/></p>
<p><strong>If you click on the 'Your Repositories' dropdown option:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The url changes to github.com/bnia?tab=repositories**</li>
<li>The navigational tab on the topmost of my homepage will change from 'Overview' to 'Repositories'.
